# React Google Books

## Description
A web app that takes advantage of a full suite of MERN-stack tools in order to allow you to search for books via the Google Books API, and add them to your favorites list. You can then view your favorited books via the 'Saved' link in the navbar.

## Usage
You can search for books via the search bar on the 'Search' page. This shows the first 10 results returned by the Google Books API. Click on the 'Save' button that appears at the top right of any book to save it to your favorites list. You will then see the 'Save' button be replaced by a 'Remove' button, which will let you remove the book from your favorites list. You can also use the 'View' button at the top right of any book to go to it's page in the Google Books store.

Finally, click the 'Saved' link on the navbar at the top to see all of your favorited books, with the ability to either remove them from your favorites or view their Google Books page as well.
